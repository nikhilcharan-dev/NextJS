Here in [NextJs],

It is somewhat similar to React as it developed from react by Vercel
It primarily works on File Based Routing System

    - npx create-next-app@latest [project-name]

We Code in src / app folder because, it is the entry point of the next web-app

## Mainly
Here, There are two types of Components

1. Server Components
2. React Components

    # page.tsx [It is the only file where we write our components and using this only Next can detect component at a specific route]
        - A page.tsx file inside [app/] corresponds to a specific route.

    # layout.tsx [it is the file Which wraps pages to provide consistent structure]
        - It allows you to maintain UI elements (like headers, footers, or sidebars) across multiple pages without reloading them.
