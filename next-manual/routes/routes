In Next,
as Next has a file based routing system powered by Vercel
we don't need to explicitly define our routes and are automatically created by the next

there are two types of routes
1. Static Routes
2. Dynamic Routes

NOTE: Both routes allow nesting

1. Static Routes:
    these are created typically
    
    EX :- 
    RouteName (folder)
        - page.tsx/js (file)

    simple and direct

2. Dynamic Routes
    these routes are specifically created by enclosing the route name within closed braces [routename]
    EX :-
    [RouteName] (folder)
        - page.tsx/js (file)
    
    efficient for handling more routes within a single folder


NOTE: A Route becomes publicly accesible only when we add a page.tsx file
